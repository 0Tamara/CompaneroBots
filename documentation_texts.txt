Communication (Tomas):
  All of our robots communicate between each other via esp-now protocol.
  We chose it, because it's simple, fast, and doesn't rely on central server 
    - if one of the robots fails, all the others work independently.
  In the fist part of our performance, the camra sends instructions to other robots.
  When the music starts, the drummer keeps track of the beat, while camera coltrols the dancer.
Drummer (Tomas):
  Our drummer has 2 side drums and 1 large kick drum.
  Each drum is equipped with an adressable RGB LED strip for better visual experience.
  He plays to the rythm of the songs and everytime he hits the drum, it lights up.
  The drummer also plays a key role in synchronization.
  When the music plays, he counts the beat and sends it wirelessly to other robots.
