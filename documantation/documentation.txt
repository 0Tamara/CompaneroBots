  Na zacatku sa kazdy pred tou istou stenou predstavi, potom povieme nieco spolu, ako napr. "And we are companerobots" a potom zacne kazdy ohladom svojho robota vypravat
  
  Communication
    All of our robots have ESP32 microcontrollers and communicate between each other via the esp-now protocol.
    We chose it because it's simple, fast, and doesn't rely on central server
      - if one of the robots fails, the others continue working independently.
    In the first part of our performance, the camra sends instructions to the other robots.
    When the music starts, the drummer keeps track of the beat, while camera controls the dancer.

  Drummer
    Our drummer robot is equipped with two side drums and one large kick drum.
    Beyond performance, the drummer plays a key role in synchronizing the entire system.
      —he counts the beats and wirelessly sends timing signals to the other robots, ensuring they stay in perfect sync with the music.
    Each drum features an addressable RGB LED strip for better visual effects.
      As he plays to the rhythm of the music, the drums light up with every hit.
    He is powered by 2 Li-Ion 18650 batteries.
      It has a DC-DC converter to 5V, 2 MG90S servo motors for the movement of its elbows, and a MG996R servo motor for the kick drum.
    The reason we chose servo motors is because they are affortable, easy to program and fast and strong enough for our usage.
    We used the dual-core feature of the ESP32 microcontroller. Thanks to that, the drummer can light up the LEDs while playing and synchronizing with the beat.

  Dancer
    The dancer moves thanks to 4 DC motors with mecanum wheels and dances with 4 MG996R servo motors that are in its elbows and shoulders.
      We chose mecanum wheels because we wanted the robot to be able to move in every direction.
    On the base is a 7.4V LiPo battery, 2 12V converters, and motor drivers for the DC motors. The 5V converter powers all the other parts of the robot.
    The dancer works alone or together with a camera on a tripod. The camera is tracking movement, and the dancer mirrors the movements of the tracked person.

  Scenery
    The power system of the scenery consists of 2 Li-Ion 18650 batteries, a power switch, and a 5V converter.
    The microcontroller is ESP32, which controls a DC motor. The motor turns 2 pulleys. While one pulley is winding up the string, the other is unwinding.
    2 ends of the string are running between the sides of the curtains, and each curtain is tied with one of them.
    Originally we had 2 motors that opened the scenery. However we upgraded the system so that we only need one motor and the scenery opens and closes. 

  Camera
    The power system of the camera consists of 2 Li-Ion 18650 batteries, a power switch, and a 5V converter.
    The microprocessor Raspberry Pi 4 handles the camera recognition and is connected to an ESP32 via UART.
    Data from the camera recognition is transmitted through the ESP32, which communicates with other robots wirelessly using ESP-NOW protocol.
    The entire setup is attached to the camera tripod.

  Problems
    We came across a couple of problems during creation of our performance.
    One of them is that we couldn't find steel axles for our wheels.
      We decided to make 3D-printed ones but they were too fragile and had to be replaced frequently.
      We came up with the idea to keep the 3D-printed parts but improve them with inserted aluminum threads which solved the problem.
  Pianist mechanics
    The Pianist robot can play almost any easy to intermediate song thanks to its construction, hardware, and software.
    The 5V slot profiles ensure the structure remains stable. Although we initially considered using wood, it was ruled out due to its tendency to warp over time.
    Each hand is driven by a single GT2 belt. During the design phase, we experimented with different motor placements but ultimately chose a kit for moving that allows
    both hands to move on the same V-slot. To adjust belt tension, we added two tensioners on the sides of the profile.
    To organize the electronics, we needed a holder — and that’s where problems began. We first considered solenoids to press the keys, but they required high 
    voltage and were too heavy. Instead, we chose MG90s servos, which are lighter and more agile, though slower.
    To fit one servo per key, the holder had to match the length of one octave. However, the servos were wider than the keys, so we angled the entire holder at 68 degrees to make them fit.
  Pianist HW
    In the middle section there's 7.4V LiPo battery powering the whole system, esp32 microcontroller controlling the whole pianist and a power switch.
    From the middle section power and data cables are brought to both hands.
    On each hand there's the stepper motor with a driver, 8 servo motors connected to an I2C driver and a DC-DC converter to 5V for servos.
